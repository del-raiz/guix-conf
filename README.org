  My personal GNU Guix OS (System & Home) + StumpWM Configuration!

  [[file:./assets/guix+stumpwm_desktop.png]]

    This is specifically setup and trailed with my Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon 4th
  Gen (Type 20FB) Laptop.

* Guix OS Configuration

  I am currently configuring Guix SD for Clasp Common Lisp and Guile Scheme
  development.

  The config directory comprises of those applications/frameworks which I have
  personaly setup (and not all my 'dot files' are therein).
  Currently using a shell script to deploy, but am working on setting up a
  full Guix deployment, however, maintaining original source code rather
  than writting it in Guile as some do.

** Guix OS (System + Home + Channels)

I've set up my entire config in =guix-config.scm=, which comprises of System, Home, and the channels for both. This is done using =guix-home-service-type=. With this, I only need to call =guix system reconfigure guix-confic.scm=, which replaces =guix pull=, =guix home reconfigure=, and =guix system reconfigure=.
I am using channels subsitutes via =specifications->tranformations= function
I defined based on the Guix manual's prescription.

Define system-level services & packages:
- 1. =%system-services=
   - Set OpenSSH, CUPs, Screenlocker, and Bluetooth services
   - =%desktop-services= - modify-services to utilizes package substitutes now.
   - =guix-home-service-type= -> TODO: would like to handle both concurrently
- 2. =%stumpwm-packages= - Window Manager
  Note that packages are specified only as symbols and not using
  =specifications->packages=.
  SBCL, SBCL-*, StumpWM+Slynk and stumpwm-contrib installed at the system
  level.
  font.
  - =sbcl=
  - =sbcl-*=
  - =stumpwm+slynk=
  - =sbcl-stumpwm-*=
- 3. =%x11-util-packages= - Window System, X11 util packages and base fonts
  - =font-hack=
  - =font-jetbrains-mono=
  - =bluez=
  - =blueman=
  - =x*=

Define user-level services & packages - note packages are specified as
symbols, not using =specifications->packages=:
- 1. =%logoraz-packages= -> My everyday packages (fonts, apps, utils/tools)
- 2. =%emacs-packages= -> Use Guix to setup Emacs (it's all there!)
- 3. =services= -> wip (todo: modularize to separate variable definitions)
  - =home-environment-variables-service-type=
  - =home-dbus-service-type=
  - =home-pipewire-service-type=
  - =home-bash-service-type=
  - TODO: Implement =home-xdg-configuration-files-service-type=
  - TODO: Implment =home-files-service-type=
  - TODO: Modularize services, i.e. define list outside =home-environment= in variable.

Current list of defined channels and whether they are active and/or pinned at a specific commit:
- Guix
- Nonguix
- guixrus
- flatwhatson
- rde
- benoitj
- TBD

** Manifests (=./config/guix/manifests/=)
- =devtools-manifest.scm=  - Dev Packages in general and for Common Lisp
- =org-docs-manifest.scm=  - Latex packages for Org document generation

I use these manifests as follows for consistent environments with packages I
need without bloating my home configuration:

#+begin_src sh

  $ guix shell -m devtools-manifest.scm -- emacs
  # or
  $ guix shell -m org-docs-manifest.scm -- emacs

#+end_src

** Installation

Basic Instructions on how to install Guix System
*** Live Image/ISO

 I specifically used the guix-installer, but next time my give the
 =guix-live-image= a try... best to have both present for reference.
 Also note that one can use the nonguix images provided on item 3.

 3. https://gitlab.com/nonguix/nonguix/-/releases
    - https://gitlab.com/nonguix/nonguix

*** Create usb installation media

For a quick reference on how to create usb installation media:

- List information about block devices (i.e. see what disks you have and find
  your usb)

#+begin_src sh

  $ lsblk

#+end_src

- Create your usb installation media (note: =sdX -> sdb= for me)

#+begin_src sh

  $ sudo dd if=guix-installer-<date number>.iso of=/dev/sdX status=progress

#+end_src

*** Graphical Installer Procedure

Followed =SystemCrafters= prescription for installation:

- [[https://systemcrafters.net/craft-your-system-with-guix/full-system-install/][systemcrafters:craft-your-own-system-with-guix]]

** Deploy

*** Initial setup/deployment (WIP)

Plan is to configure system/home services to deloy, i.e create all
necessary locations and copy configs to their proper locations -> still working on refining this to follow the =Guix Way=. Currently using shell scripts to either establish hard and/or soft links to the desired
locations, i.e. `~/.config/`, `~/.`, etc.

#+begin_src sh

  # Get guix home setup
  mkdir ~/repos/
  cd ~/repos
  git clone https://github.com/logoraz/guix-craft.git
  cd guix-craft/

  # Deploy the configuration to ~/.config/
  # Use the deployment scripts in each config module:

  # Setup Guix files
  ./config/guix/deploy-guix.sh

  # Setup StumpWM config files
  ./config/stumpwm/deploy-stumpwm.sh

  # Setup X11 (Xorg) environment files for StumpWM
  ./config/xorg/deploy-xorg.sh

  # Setup Emacs config files
  ./config/emacs/deploy-emacs.sh

  # Setup Nyxt config files
  ./config/nyxt/deploy-nyxt.sh

  # Setup Common Lisp Environment (quicklisp, FFI (WIP), etc.)
  ./config/common-lisp/deploy-cl.sh

  guix pull
  sudo guix system reconfigure system.scm
  guix home reconfigure home.scm

  # Optional Clean-up afterwards when everything is working
  guix pull --delete-generations
  guix package --delete-generations
  guix home delete-generations
  sudo guix system delete-generations
  guix gc
  # guix gc -d1w # delete generations older than 1 week

#+end_src

*** Connecting to Wifi via CLI

Don't have yet a GUI for managing wifi connections in my StumpWM setup, so
typically connect via command line, and so putting here as a reminder to myself:

#+begin_src sh

  # List Wifi networks available
  $ sudo nmcli device wifi list

  # Connect to ESSID
  $ sudo nmcli device wifi connect <ESSID> password <network-password>

#+end_src

List known connections and delete them from list in Network Manager.

#+begin_src sh

  # Get ESSID (name) or UUID of connection to delete
  $ sudo nmcli connection show

  # Delete connection via ID (aka name or ESSID)
  $ sudo nmcli connection delete <ESSID>

#+end_src

** Common Lisp Stuff

Some Common Lisp stuff I've trialed out in Guix System:

*** Clasp

The Clasp Common Lisp compiler is a project of extreme high interest to
me - Clasp is a new Common Lisp implementation that seamlessly
interoperates with C++ libraries and programs using LLVM for compilation
to native code. See: https://github.com/clasp-developers/clasp

They currently have a guix package recipe that hasn't yet made its way
upstream, as it has a bit complex build model due to git submodules:

I have it currently installed to my .guix-profle, but may resort to
installing it via guix shell only, so as to follow the "Guix way..."

Installation Instructions:

#+begin_src sh

  # Clone to a directory of your choice
  $ git clone https://github.com/clasp-developers/clasp.git \
    ~/repos/builds/clasp/

  $ cd ~/repos/builds/clasp/
  $ guix shell --pure git nss-certs sbcl -- ./koga
  # Note: Koga will error out after downloading the dependencies,
  # when trying to configure clasp.
  $ guix build -f guix/clasp.scm


  # Perhaps install via guix shell for the future
  # one caveat is that it will be removed once you perform guix gc
  # I have not yet trialed the below code:
  $ guix shell -D -f guix/clasp.scm
  # then you can invoke it with whatever program you'd like, say emacs:
  $ guix shell -D -f guix/clasp.scm -- emacs

#+end_src

*** Installing Lem

I created a Guix package recipe for Lem, which can be found [[https://github.com/logoraz/lem-guix-package-recipe][here]], clone and install with
Guix via:

#+begin_src sh

  $ guix package -f path/to/lem-guix-packaging/package.scm

#+end_src

*Note:* I no longer plan to contribute to Lem due to their distasteful ethics towards
Common Lisp newcomers and Guix users. A few rude, pompous contributors to the
project and their interactions with me on DM's is what lead to this... Not sure if I will update this package recipe any longer knowing it will contribute to that negative
social environment.
My Lem config is kept in the archive directory of this repo.

*** ChemScribe
A work in progress of a Common Lisp (Clasp) application I am writing for
my line of chemistry work. Right now it is a base scaffolding and scratch
work as I learn more about Common Lisp...

Reference my repo: https://github.com/logoraz/ChemScribe


* StumpWM Configuration

My personal StumpWM configuration - I prefer to follow the XDG-style configuration, as
prescribed on https://github.com/stumpwm/stumpwm/wiki/Customize. I like things modular,
so it is set up as such.

** Initialization File:  =~/.config/stumpwm/config=

Loads in modules and set's up core features, such as my X11 environment.

** Modules: =~/.config/stumpwm/modules/*=

These probably aren't qualified to be called modules, but they are akin to stand-alone
common-lisp scripts, they currently have a predefined order to be called in StumpWM
config.lisp -> config.
- =auto-start= - Setup X11 environment & controls
- =colors= - Define color pallet for StumpWM
- =syntax= - Helper Functions, and Macros for StumpWM (wip)
- =frames= - Frame/Window configurations
- =keybindings= - The heart and sole of the StumpWM configuration
- =modeline= - Setup & customize StumpWM modeline
- =theme= - Set appearance/style of StumpWM
- =utilities= - Utility packages/libraries, ad-hoc customizations & commands.

** Libraries: =~/.config/stumpwm/libraries/*=

These are personally developed StumpWM CL packages, to be loaded similarily
to StumpWM-Contrib packages. Note I've modiefied most of these contrib
packages slighly to suit my use needs and updated their package definitions
minimizing `:use` in place of `:import-from` as suggested by the
Common Lisp Cookbook best practices:
- =stumpwm-wpctl= - converted to package/library
  - A fork of https://github.com/Junker/stumpwm-wpctl
  - configured/loaded in "config.lisp --> config"
- =bluetooth= - converted to a package/library
  - Borrowed from https://config.phundrak.com/stumpwm#bluetooth
  - configured/loaded in "config.lisp --> config"
- =screenshot= - Improved from stumpwm-contrib/util/screenshot
  - Enhanced functionality - no longer need to write path & filename
    into a prompt.
  - configured/loaded in "utilities.lisp"
- =end-session= - A la carte from stumpwm-contrib/util, staged for improvements
  - configured/loaded in "config.lisp --> config"
- =stump-nmctl= - TODO: make a CL interface to nmcli for StumpWM

** Guix [[https://github.com/stumpwm/stumpwm-contrib][stumpwm-contrib]] modules:
These are the =stumpwm-contrib= modules available in Guix that I am using.
- stumpwm-contrib/util:
  - =kbd-layouts=: configured/loaded in "keybindings.lisp"
  - =ttf-fonts=: configured/loaded in "theme.lisp"
  - =swm-gaps=: configured/loaded in "frames.lisp"
  - =global-windows= - configured/loaded in "config.lisp"
- stumpwm-contrib/modeline:
  - =cpu=: configured/loaded in "modeline.lisp"
  - =mem=: configured/loaded in "modeline.lisp"
  - =wifi=: configured/loaded in "modeline.lisp"
  - =battery-portable=: configured/loaded in "modeline.lisp"
